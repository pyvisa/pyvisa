#    HP34401A_measure_currents.py - functions with PyVisa to monitor currents
#      using a HP34401A multimeter. It supposes that there is only one GPIB
#      instrument (the HP34401A multimeter) plugged to the computer.
#      To use this example just put the example in the directory where you
#      call python then just run:
#      $> python
#      >>> from HP34401A_measure_currents.py import *
#      >>> contMeasA( "file.csv" )
#      Hit Ctrl-C when you have finished
#      Use your favorite plotting program to review the measurements (GnuPlot
#       is a good candidate)
#      $> gnuplot
#      >>> set datafile separator ";"
#      >>> plot 'file.csv' using 1:2 with lines
