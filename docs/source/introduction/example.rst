A more complex example
======================

.. include:: ../substitutions.sub

The following example shows how to use SCPI commands with a Keithley
2000 multimeter in order to measure 10 voltages. After having read
them, the program calculates the average voltage and prints it on the
screen.

I'll explain the program step-by-step.  First, we have to initialize
the instrument::

   >>> keithley = rm.open_resource("GPIB::12")
   >>> keithley.write("*rst; status:preset; *cls")

Here, we create the instrument variable *keithley*, which is used for
all further operations on the instrument.  Immediately after it, we
send the initialization and reset message to the instrument.

The next step is to write all the measurement parameters, in
particular the interval time (500ms) and the number of readings (10)
to the instrument.  I won't explain it in detail.  Have a look at an
SCPI and/or Keithley 2000 manual.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> interval_in_ms = 500
   >>> number_of_readings = 10
   >>> keithley.write("status:measurement:enable 512; *sre 1")
   >>> keithley.write("sample:count %d" % number_of_readings)
   >>> keithley.write("trigger:source bus")
   >>> keithley.write("trigger:delay %f" % (interval_in_ms / 1000.0))
   >>> keithley.write("trace:points %d" % number_of_readings)
   >>> keithley.write("trace:feed sense1; trace:feed:control next")

Okay, now the instrument is prepared to do the measurement.  The next
three lines make the instrument wait for a trigger pulse, trigger
it, and wait until it sends a "service request"::

   >>> keithley.write("initiate")
   >>> keithley.assert_trigger()
   >>> keithley.wait_for_srq()

By sending the service request, the instrument tells us that the
measurement has been finished and that the results are ready for
transmission.  We could read them with `keithley.query("trace:data?")`
however, then we'd get:

.. code-block:: none

   -000.0004E+0,-000.0005E+0,-000.0004E+0,-000.0007E+0,
   -000.0000E+0,-000.0007E+0,-000.0008E+0,-000.0004E+0,
   -000.0002E+0,-000.0005E+0

which we would have to convert to a Python list of numbers.
Fortunately, the |query_ascii_values| method does this work for us::

   >>> voltages = keithley.query_ascii_values("trace:data?")
   >>> print("Average voltage: ", sum(voltages) / len(voltages))

Finally, we should reset the instrument's data buffer and SRQ status
register, so that it's ready for a new run.  Again, this is explained
in detail in the instrument's manual::

   >>> keithley.query("status:measurement?")
   >>> keithley.write("trace:clear; trace:feed:control next")

That's it. 18 lines of lucid code.  (Well, SCPI is awkward, but
that's another story.)
