PyVISA Changelog
================

1.11 (unreleased)
-----------------

PyVISA 1.11 introduces a small backward incompatibility in the handling of
the arguments to handlers for VISA events. The old system was tightly linked to
the ctwrapper and not really usable as it was. As a consequence we pass
the contents of the ctypes objects to the handler rather than the bare ctypes
object (with the exception of the user handle for which there is no way to do
it properly). This is a breaking change and if your code is affected you can revert
to the old behavior by setting the environment variable PYVISA_WRAP_HANDLER=0 or
set ctwrapper.WRAP_HANDLER to False but please consider updating to the new
behavior.

- Convert the testsuite to use pytest PR #531
  This is motivated by the possibility to re-use it in PyVISA-py. However since
  unittest use inheritance to detect tests, doing so would have been clunky, pytest
  name base detection works better for that purpose.

  extended set of tests. PR #531

1.9.1 (2018-08-13)
------------------

- Add expect_termination argument to read_binary_values and
  query_binary_values. This allows to retain the behavior of these methods from
  pyvisa 1.8, where the length of the block of values that is being read did
  not include the very final read termination. For instruments omitting the
  termination character when transferring binary data, visa  library raises a
  timeout exception in case pyvisa 1.9.0 is used. Note that the behavior is not
  reverted completely to its pyvisa 1.8 state because for other instruments
  (for example, Keysight PNA on Ethernet) the termination character is indeed
  added at the end of the message, and is not counted in the declared length in
  the header. Prior to 1.9, if the last character of the binary block is also
  the termination character, the actual termination could be missed, which
  leads to hard to debug bugs hence the choice to preserve 1.9 behavior by
  default. PR #349
- fix an encoding handling issue in setup.py PR #343
- if installed use pyvisa-py backend if a binary VISA implementation is not
  installed. PR #341
- make custom exception hashable by removing __eq__. This should not impact
